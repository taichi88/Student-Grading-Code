I wanted to deepen my understanding in relation between classes
so I built this project as a learning exercise.
This code is written in Python 3.
It defines a Student class for managing individual student records, including adding grades and calculating the average grade.
Additionally, it includes a StudentManagementSystem class for managing multiple students, a
llowing for the addition of students, as well as displaying their details and average grades. 
This system provides a structured way to handle student information and operations in an organized manner.
